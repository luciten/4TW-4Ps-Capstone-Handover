# 4Ps Regional Performance Analysis

The Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) is a key national initiative aimed at reducing poverty. Its impact, however, varies across regions due to differences in local conditions, service access, and socioeconomic constraints. This analysis identifies regions with the weakest performance in 4Ps outcome areas and recommends targeted interventions to enhance program effectiveness.

## Stakeholders
- Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD)  
- Local Government Units (LGUs)  
- Planning and Social Welfare Officers  

## Focus Areas
1. Health and Nutrition  
2. Education  
3. Child Labor  
4. Community Participation  

## Methodology
Matrix-style regional comparisons were conducted using Excel workbooks, providing flexible, editable visualizations not easily achievable in Tableau dashboards.  

## Key Findings
- **Health & Nutrition:** BARMM and nearby regions show the lowest outcomes, especially in immunization and prenatal visits.  
- **Education:** Most regions achieve 70–80% enrollment; BARMM remains significantly lower.  
- **Child Labor:** Persistent in vulnerable areas like Region X.  
- **Community Participation:** FDS attendance often falls below the 95% target.  

Low performance across multiple domains indicates systemic local barriers that limit 4Ps impact despite program coverage.

## Recommendations
Focus on regions consistently underperforming across multiple indicators. Implement evidence-based, region-specific interventions to address gaps in health, education, child labor prevention, and community participation. Tailored strategies can strengthen 4Ps effectiveness and improve overall outcomes.
