# Limitations and Next Steps  
### 4Ps Regional Performance and Intervention Analysis

---

## Data Limitations

The analysis faced several constraints due to the datasets used:

- Different datasets came from different years, limiting direct comparisons.  
- Some 4Ps quarterly reports were missing or incomplete.  
- Certain regions had missing or incomplete reports, particularly in conflict-affected or geographically isolated areas.  
- Data came in mixed formats (PDFs, CSVs) and some fields required decoding, which increased the risk of errors.  

These limitations mean some results may not fully capture the actual performance, especially for health, education, and child labor indicators.


## Technical Limitations

- No centralized dashboard tool was used; Excel workbooks were the primary method.  
- Tableau, while capable of dashboards, could not support matrix-style comparisons and flexible axis editing, so Excel matrices were necessary for regional performance analysis.  
- Manual data cleaning was used for some PDF tables to maintain accuracy.
- Hard-coded paths and scripts were used for some tasks, which makes scaling or automating the workflow fragile.
  

## Next Steps (If More Time Were Available)

1. Build an interactive Tableau dashboard to improve visualization and exploration.  
2. Integrate more years of data to analyze trends over time.  
3. Incorporate additional poverty drivers and local factors:  
   - **Health and Nutrition:** health facility density  
   - **Education:** school accessibility (distance to nearest school)  
   - **Child Labor:** gender distribution and type of work  
4. Validate unusual or extreme values with regional sources to ensure accuracy.  
5. Enhance comparison matrices for clearer identification of low-performing regions across multiple indicators.
