# Source Description

The datasets compiled in this inventory are sourced primarily from major Philippine government agencies, including the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), and the Department of Education (DepEd). 

These sources provide authoritative, nationally recognized data covering key socioeconomic indicators such as health outcomes, poverty levels, income distribution, education enrollment, and social assistance compliance. 

Most datasets are extracted from official surveys, annual reports, and quarterly implementation documents, ensuring reliability, standardized methodologies, and consistent metadata. This inventory consolidates these resources into a unified reference table to support analysis, reporting, and data-driven program design.
