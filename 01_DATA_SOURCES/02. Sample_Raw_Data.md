# Sample Raw Data

To illustrate how the raw world of our data sources originally appeared before processing, this section presents anonymized sample extracts taken from the main datasets from DSWD, DepEd, and PSA. The purpose is not to show complete data but to show how messy, unstructured, or coded these sources were in their original form.

For the DSWD Implementation Report and the DepEd Enrollment Rate statistics, the raw materials were provided only in PDF format, which means the tables embedded in these files were not directly exportable. We used Tabula in Python to scrape the tables. The process required multiple iterations to optimize extraction because cells sometimes merged, headers spilled into adjacent rows, and numeric columns were read as strings. We validated the output by cross-checking row counts, detecting misaligned columns, and adjusting Tabula extraction areas until the resulting tables matched the source layout.
