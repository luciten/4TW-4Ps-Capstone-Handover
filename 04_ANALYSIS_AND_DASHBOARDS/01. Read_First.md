# 4Ps Regional Performance Dashboard

A summary view of Education, Health & Nutrition, Child Labor, and Community Participation.  

**Note on Data Presentation:**  
The team uses **XLSX files** for presenting regional performance and success indicators in a **matrix format**. This is necessary because **Tableau cannot display editable matrices**, it only allows scatterplots and other charts, and the axes cannot be freely adjusted for this type of analysis. Using Excel matrices allows us to **directly measure and compare regions against targets** for each indicator.
